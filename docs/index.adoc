= Welcome to context-mapper-cli
:toc:

CLI for https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl[context mapper].

Created to be used in https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-diagram[asciidoctor-diagram].

== Limitation

This CLI is meant to produce only `png` or `svg` files. Capabilities like producing `puml` is not available.

== Main goal

This CLI has been made to be embeded into https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-diagram[asciidoctor-diagram],
the size of the final JAR is important.

Moreover, it should offer API taking stream for input and output, to mimic the way `plantuml` and `ditaa` are used.
